# Modelling-Simulation

Project 2 -->
      Simulate on computer the evolution (at least 20 generations) of an elementary 
      CAthat works according to the rule number specified by the user. Assume that•a grid contains at least 41 cells,
      •boundary conditions are periodic (fold the grid),•initial configuration is random or determined by the user.

Project 3 --> 
      Simulate the evolution of Game of Life. Implement periodic boundary conditions(that glue each pair of opposite sides of the grid).
      
Project 4 -->
      Simulate the evolution of dog-flea model, assuming that there are 20 fleas in thesystem and that all fleas are sitting on one dog at time t=0. Record the               states of thesystem in first 20 time-steps. Check after how many iterations the system returnsto the initial state.
